# 01 - Build a Tribute Page

## View online at: [Tribute Page](https://codepen.io/lvltcode/full/XQOLXX)
  
## **Objective**: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this page](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx).

You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

## User Stories (**required**) functionalities are completed:

* [x] **User Story #1**: My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
* [x] **User Story #2**: I should see an element with a corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
* [x] **User Story #3**: I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".
* [x] **User Story #4**: Within the img-div element, I should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".
* [x] **User Story #5**: Within the img-div element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in img-div.
* [x] **User Story #6**: I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
* [x] **User Story #7**: I should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank").
* [x] **User Story #8**: The img element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
* [x] **User Story #9**: The img element should be centered within its parent element.

# 02 - Build a Survey Form

## View online at: [Survey Form](https://codepen.io/lvltcode/full/wZOoyp)
  
## **Objective**: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this page]( https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP).

You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk.

Happy coding!

## User Stories (**required**) functionalities are completed:

* [x] **User Story #1**: I can see a title with `id="title"` in H1 sized text.
* [x] **User Story #2**: I can see a short explanation with `id="description"` in P sized text.
* [x] **User Story #3**: I can see a form with `id="survey-form"`.
* [x] **User Story #4**: Inside the form element, I am required to enter my name in a field with `id="name"`.
* [x] **User Story #5**: Inside the form element, I am required to enter an email in a field with `id="email"`.
* [x] **User Story #6**: If I enter an email that is not formatted correctly, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
* [x] **User Story #7**: Inside the form, I can enter a number in a field with `id="number"`.
* [x] **User Story #8**: If I enter non-numbers in the number input, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
* [x] **User Story #9**: If I enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, I will see an HTML5 validation error.
* [x] **User Story #10**: For the name, email, and number input fields inside the form I can see corresponding labels that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: `id="name-label"`, `id="email-label"`, and `id="number-label"`.
* [x] **User Story #11**: For the name, email, and number input fields, I can see placeholder text that gives me a description or instructions for each field.
* [x] **User Story #12**: Inside the form element, I can select an option from a dropdown that has a corresponding `id="dropdown"`.
* [x] **User Story #13**: Inside the form element, I can select a field from one or more groups of radio buttons. Each group should be grouped using the name attribute.
* [x] **User Story #14**: Inside the form element, I can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a `value` attribute.
* [x] **User Story #15**: Inside the form element, I am presented with a `textarea` at the end for additional comments.
* [x] **User Story #16**: Inside the form element, I am presented with a button with `id="submit"` to submit all my inputs.
